        "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  \n",
        "NLP is a field at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, focused on enabling computers to interact with and understand human language. It involves teaching machines to analyze, process, and generate natural language, which includes both text and speech.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts:**\n",
        "- **Problem**: NLP tackles the problem of how to program computers to process and analyze large volumes of natural language data. Human languages are complex, with variations in grammar, syntax, and context, making this a challenging task for machines. The goal is to make computers capable of understanding and responding to human language effectively.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Challenge**: One of the biggest challenges in NLP is dealing with unstructured data. Unlike structured data (e.g., tables and databases), natural language is unstructured and often ambiguous. Words can have multiple meanings, sentences can have different interpretations, and context can change the meaning of a phrase. Teaching machines to handle this variability is difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ultimate Goal**: The ultimate goal of NLP is to give machines the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful and useful. This includes reading and comprehending text, engaging in conversations, answering questions, and translating between languagesâ€”all with an understanding of the nuances of human communication. The ideal outcome is that machines can not only process language but also derive accurate meanings and insights from it."

        "\n",
        "1. **Search Engines**: Enhances search capabilities by understanding and interpreting user queries to provide relevant search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text, enabling voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa to understand and respond to user commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Machine Translation**: Translates text from one language to another, as seen in services like Google Translate and DeepL.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind it, used in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Text Summarization**: Creates concise summaries of longer documents, useful for quickly grasping the main points of articles, reports, or research papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and classifies entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more within text, used in information extraction and document indexing.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Facilitates automated interactions with users through conversational agents that understand and respond to natural language queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Information Extraction**: Extracts specific pieces of information from unstructured text, such as extracting key facts from news articles or legal documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Text Classification**: Categorizes text into predefined categories, used for spam detection in emails, topic categorization, and content moderation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Recommendation Systems**: Provides personalized recommendations by analyzing user preferences and behavior, used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Grammar and Spell Checking**: Identifies and corrects grammatical errors and spelling mistakes in text, improving writing quality and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Topic Modeling**: Discovers the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents, used for organizing and summarizing large datasets of text."

        "- **Word Tokenization**: Breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens, which are the basic units for text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Text Lemmatization and Stemming**: Techniques used to reduce words to their base or root forms. Lemmatization involves converting words to their dictionary form, while stemming cuts words down to their stem or root form.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Stop Words**: Commonly used words (such as \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is\") that are often filtered out from the text because they do not contribute significant meaning for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regex (Regular Expressions)**: Patterns used to match and manipulate specific sequences of characters within text, aiding in tasks such as extracting or cleaning data."

            "Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n",
            "\n",
            "Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation, as one people. Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\n",
            "\n",
            "One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a Government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted, immediately and aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life's become that much harder.\n",
            "\n",
            "This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.\n",

            "For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated, some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\n",
            "\n",
            "So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope, what they deserve, is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.\n",
            "\n",
            "And you know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, \"We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "It's because of this spirit, this great decency and great strength, that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our Union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a Government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength. And tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\n",
            "\n",
            "It begins with our economy. Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. I hated it; you hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal. \n",
            "\n",
            "But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular; I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banksâ€”most but not all.\n",
            "\n",
            "To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed. That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time home buyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. I thought I'd get some applause on that one. \n",
            "\n",
            "As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single personâ€”not a single dime.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first-responders. And we're on track to add another 1Â½ million jobs to this total by the end of the year.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are stories like this all across America. And after 2 years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. I agree, absolutely. But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products. Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information.\n",
            "\n",
            "We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will. People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\n",
            "\n",
            "We can't afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade, what some call the \"lost decade,\" where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while. For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?\n",
            "\n",
            "You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations areâ€”they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America. As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear powerplants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's the thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a world-class education. And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\n",
            "\n",
            "To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants. And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 yearsâ€”and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college. And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.\n",
            "\n",
            "And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\n",
            "\n",
            "After nearly a century of tryingâ€”Democratic administrations, Republican administrationsâ€”we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\n",
            "\n",
            "And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. Thank you, honey. She gets embarrassed. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, \"What's in it for me?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this Chamber.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm eager to see it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a 1-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door. \n",
            "\n",
            "Nowâ€”just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That too is a fact.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The Federal Government should do the same. So tonight I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary Government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\n",
            "\n",
            "We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works. But understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is, that's what we did for 8 years. That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common senseâ€”a novel concept.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, that's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts onâ€”our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions. But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client, with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office.\n",
            "\n",
            "With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicansâ€”Democrats and Republicans. Look, you've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent. \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony andâ€”some postpartisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.\n",
            "\n",
            "But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation ofâ€”I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators.\n",
            "\n",
            "Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our Government. So, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\n",

Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.

And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in relitigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.

We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.\n",

We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose.

To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\n",

That's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated.

That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea.

Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith.

        "\n",
        "Sentence tokenization, also known as sentence segmentation, is the process of dividing a continuous piece of text into its individual sentences. Although this might seem like a straightforward task, it involves several complexities that need to be addressed for accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Basic Approach**\n",
        "\n",
        "In many languages, including English, sentences are often separated by punctuation marks such as periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?). At a basic level, sentence tokenization involves splitting text whenever one of these punctuation marks is encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Challenges in Sentence Tokenization**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Abbreviations**: Periods used in abbreviations (e.g., \"Dr.\" for \"Doctor\" or \"e.g.\" for \"for example\") do not indicate the end of a sentence. Tokenization algorithms need to distinguish these cases to avoid incorrect sentence breaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Decimal Points**: Periods in numerical contexts (e.g., \"3.14\" or \"1.5\") might be confused with sentence-ending periods. Proper tokenization must recognize that such periods are part of numbers, not sentence boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quotes and Parentheses**: Punctuation within quotes or parentheses can complicate sentence boundaries. For instance, a period inside quotation marks (e.g., \"He said, 'Hello.'\") might not signal the end of a sentence, but rather a sentence-ending punctuation within the quote.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Advanced Techniques**\n",
        "\n",
        "To handle these complexities, modern sentence tokenization methods often employ algorithms and models that use context and rules to correctly identify sentence boundaries. These methods consider the surrounding text, punctuation, and common language patterns to ensure accurate segmentation."

        "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from nltk.corpus.reader import wordlist\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - This line imports the `wordlist` module from NLTKâ€™s `corpus.reader` package. However, it seems like `wordlist` is not used in the code snippet provided. This might be an oversight or a remnant from another part of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sentence Tokenization**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(corpus)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - `nltk.sent_tokenize(corpus)` is a function from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library that performs sentence tokenization. It takes `corpus`, which is a string containing the text to be processed, and divides it into a list of sentences.\n",
        "   - `sent_tokenize` uses pre-trained models to identify sentence boundaries, handling various punctuation and formatting issues to accurately separate sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterating Through Sentences**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   for sentence in sentences:\n",
        "       print(sentence)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - This loop iterates through each sentence in the `sentences` list. The `for` loop accesses each `sentence` one by one.\n",
        "   - `print(sentence)` outputs each sentence to the console, displaying the results of the sentence tokenization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "This code snippet tokenizes a given text (`corpus`) into sentences using NLTKâ€™s `sent_tokenize` function and then prints each sentence. The purpose is to break down the text into manageable units (sentences) and visualize the results. If youâ€™re working with a large text, this approach helps in analyzing and processing text data on a sentence-by-sentence basis."

            "That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.\n",

            "There are stories like this all across America.\n",
            "And after 2 years of recession, the economy is growing again.\n",
            "Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value.\n",
            "Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\n",
            "But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.\n",
            "That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\n",
            "Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses.\n",
            "I agree, absolutely.\n",
            "But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.\n",
            "We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss.\n",
            "Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're ready to grow.\n",
            "But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies.\n",
            "Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit.\n",
            "So tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.\n",
            "I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages.\n",
            "While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\n",
            "Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.\n",
            "From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete.\n",

            "Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act.\n",
            "There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information.\n",
            "We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs.\n",
            "And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\n",
            "Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps.\n",
            "As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will.\n",
            "They will.\n",
            "People are out of work.\n",
            "They're hurting.\n",
            "They need our help.\n",
            "And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\n",
            "But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last 2 years.\n",
            "The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\n",
            "We can't afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade, what some call the \"lost decade,\" where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\n",
            "From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious.\n",
            "I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.\n",
            "For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait?\n",
            "How long should America put its future on hold?\n",
            "You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse.\n",
            "Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy.\n",

            "Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.\n",
            "As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\n",
            "Now, one place to start is serious financial reform.\n",
            "Look, I am not interested in punishing banks.\n",

            "It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes.\n",
            "But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\n",
            "We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions.\n",
            "We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\n",
            "Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it.\n",
            "But we cannot let them win this fight.\n",
            "And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right.\n",
            "We've got to get it right.\n",
            "Next, we need to encourage American innovation.\n",
            "Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.\n",
            "And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.\n",
            "You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.\n",
            "But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives.\n",
            "And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear powerplants in this country.\n",
            "It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.\n",
            "It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies.\n",
            "And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.\n",
            "Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year.\n",
            "And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\n",
            "I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy.\n",
            "I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.\n",
            "But here's the thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy.\n",
            "And America must be that nation.\n",
            "Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America.\n",
            "So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America.\n",
            "To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.\n",
            "We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are.\n",
            "If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.\n",
            "But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.\n",
            "And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\n",
            "Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.\n",
            "Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.\n",
            "And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success.\n",
            "Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city.\n",
            "In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a world-class education.\n",
            "And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.\n",
            "When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States.\n",
            "Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job.\n",
            "That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\n",
            "To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans.\n",
            "Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants.\n",
            "And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 yearsâ€”and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\n",
            "And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\n",
            "Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class.\n",
            "That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families.\n",
            "That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg.\n",
            "That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home.\n",
            "The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.\n",
            "This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.\n",
            "And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform.\n",
            "Yes, we do.\n",
            "Now, let's clear a few things up.\n",
            "I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt.\n",
            "And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics.\n",
            "I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\n",
            "After nearly a century of tryingâ€”Democratic administrations, Republican administrationsâ€”we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans.\n",
            "The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry.\n",
            "It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.\n",
            "It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\n",
            "And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier.\n",
            "Thank you, honey.\n",
            "She gets embarrassed.\n",
            "Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan.\n",
            "It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.\n",
            "And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n",
            "Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became.\n",
            "I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people.\n",
            "And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, \"What's in it for me?\"\n",
            "But I also know this problem is not going away.\n",
            "By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance.\n",
            "Millions will lose it this year.\n",
            "Our deficit will grow.\n",
            "Premiums will go up.\n",
            "Patients will be denied the care they need.\n",
            "Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.\n",
            "I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this Chamber.\n",
            "So, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed.\n",
            "There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.\n",
            "But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.\n",
            "Let me know.\n",
            "Let me know.\n",
            "I'm eager to see it.\n",
            "Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform.\n",
            "Not now.\n",
            "Not when we are so close.\n",
            "Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people.\n",
            "Let's get it done.\n",
            "Let's get it done.\n",
            "Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves.\n",
            "It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.\n",
            "So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight.\n",
            "At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.\n",
            "By the time I took office, we had a 1-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.\n",
            "Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.\n",
            "On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget.\n",
            "All this was before I walked in the door.\n",
            "Nowâ€”just stating the facts.\n",
            "Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.\n",
            "But we took office amid a crisis.\n",
            "And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.\n",
            "That too is a fact.\n",
            "I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.\n",
            "But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions.\n",
            "The Federal Government should do the same.\n",
            "So tonight I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.\n",
            "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years.\n",
            "Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected.\n",
            "But all other discretionary Government programs will.\n",
            "Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't.\n",
            "And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\n",
            "We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work.\n",
            "We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.\n",
            "To help working families, we'll extend our middle class tax cuts.\n",
            "But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year.\n",
            "We just can't afford it.\n",
            "Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office.\n",
            "More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket.\n",
            "That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad.\n",
            "This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem.\n",
            "The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\n",
            "Now, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.\n",
            "And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\n",
            "Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting.\n",
            "And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger.\n",
            "That's how budgeting works.\n",
            "But understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\n",
            "From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.\n",
            "The problem is, that's what we did for 8 years.\n",
            "That's what helped us into this crisis.\n",
            "It's what helped lead to these deficits.\n",
            "We can't do it again.\n",
            "Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new.\n",
            "Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt.\n",
            "Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here.\n",
            "Let's try common senseâ€”a novel concept.\n",
            "Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now.\n",
            "We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years.\n",
            "To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve.\n",
            "Now, that's what I came to Washington to do.\n",
            "That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts onâ€”our White House visitors online.\n",
            "That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions.\n",
            "But we can't stop there.\n",
            "It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client, with my administration or with Congress.\n",
            "It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office.\n",
            "With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.\n",
            "I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.\n",
            "They should be decided by the American people.\n",
            "And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.\n",
            "I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicansâ€”Democrats and Republicans.\n",
            "Look, you've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more.\n",
            "For example, some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online.\n",
            "Tonight I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\n",
            "Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another.\n",
            "Now, I'm not naive.\n",
            "I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony andâ€”some postpartisan era.\n",
            "I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched.\n",
            "And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways.\n",
            "These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years.\n",
            "They're the very essence of our democracy.\n",
            "But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day.\n",
            "We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win.\n",

        "**bold text**\n",
        "In text processing, words can appear in different forms, such as various tenses or related terms. To manage these variations and simplify analysis, lemmatization and stemming are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Lemmatization**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition**: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, known as a lemma. The lemma is the standard, canonical form of a word as found in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How It Works**: Lemmatization takes into account the context and meaning of a word to determine its lemma. For example:\n",
        "  - \"studies\" becomes \"study\"\n",
        "  - \"studying\" becomes \"study\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The goal of lemmatization is to convert different forms of a word into a single, meaningful base form, which helps in accurate text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Stemming**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition**: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form by removing prefixes or suffixes, using straightforward algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How It Works**: Stemming applies rules to strip away common affixes, resulting in a root form that may not always be a valid word. For example:\n",
        "  - \"studies\" becomes \"studi\"\n",
        "  - \"studying\" becomes \"study\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The aim of stemming is to simplify words to a common base form, which can aid in text analysis. However, stemming can sometimes produce less precise or less meaningful results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "Both lemmatization and stemming aim to reduce words to a common base form, but they do so differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lemmatization** provides a precise and meaningful base form by considering the wordâ€™s context and meaning.\n",
        "- **Stemming** uses simpler rules to strip away affixes, resulting in a root form that might not always be a meaningful word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between lemmatization and stemming depends on the specific needs of the text analysis task, with lemmatization often being more accurate and stemming being faster and more straightforward."

        "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer\n",
        "   from nltk.corpus import wordnet\n",

        "   - `wordnet` is imported from the NLTK corpus to provide part-of-speech tags for lemmatization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Select a Word**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   word = filtered_sentence[12]\n",
        "   print(word)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - `word` is assigned the value of the 13th item in the `filtered_sentence` list (index 12, as indexing starts from 0).\n",
        "   - `print(word)` outputs this word to the console for reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Initialize Lemmatizer and Stemmer**:\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "   - `lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos=wordnet.VERB)` computes the lemma of `word`, treating it as a verb (`pos=wordnet.VERB`).\n",
        "   - `print` displays the lemma.\n",

        "**Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "This code snippet demonstrates how to apply lemmatization and stemming to a specific word using NLTK. The `WordNetLemmatizer` converts the word to its canonical form based on its part of speech, while the `PorterStemmer` reduces the word to its root form. The output provides both the lemma and the stem of the selected word."
