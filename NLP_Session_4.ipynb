        "\n",
        "**Traditional Programming:**\n",
        "- In traditional programming, explicit rules and instructions are written by developers to dictate how a computer should handle various scenarios. Each possible situation is accounted for by the programmer, and the system follows these predefined instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine Learning:**\n",
        "- Machine learning (ML) differs in that it allows computers to learn from data rather than relying solely on explicit instructions. ML algorithms can analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on the data. As the system is exposed to more data, it can improve its performance over time without requiring specific reprogramming.\n",

        "   - **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form.\n",
        "   - **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their base or dictionary form while considering context.\n",
        "   - **Stop Words Removal:** Filtering out common words that do not contribute to the meaning (e.g., \"the,\" \"is\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transformation:**\n",
        "   - **Feature Extraction:** Identifying and extracting relevant features from the text.\n",
        "   - **Embedding:** Representing words or phrases in a numerical format that captures semantic meaning (e.g., word embeddings).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Mining and Analysis:**\n",
        "   - **Knowledge Extraction:** Identifying patterns and insights from the text data.\n",
        "   - **Machine Learning:** Applying algorithms to learn from the data and make predictions or classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluation and Interpretation:**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Understanding the results and insights derived from the analysis.\n",

After watching it on DVD, I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant, but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories, and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.<br /><br />So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang, I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians, watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas, such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically, I actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.<br /><br />This movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie, because I think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned, and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change.<br /><br />When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime.\",\n          \"The funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot. So the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one, but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger. I guess police ammo just kinda bounces of. They decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what is wrong with these guys? They're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. Okay I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go nuts. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. They're like ten ft. away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. And then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. Bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something. I had a good laugh I guess.\",\n          \"Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again.<br /><br />The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little \\\"spin\\\" to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - Borat was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />1 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.<br /><br />A word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today.

Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. I must admit I was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly I'll be writing those recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, I assure you that you won't be disappointed.</th>\n",

Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. And who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. But nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that \"It doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play.\"</th>\n",

I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.\""

The `CountVectorizer` transforms the reviews into a matrix of token counts, which serves as numerical input for machine learning models. By setting the parameter `max_features=5000`, we limit the model to only consider the 5,000 most frequent words across all reviews, reducing the feature space and focusing on the most significant terms. After fitting the `CountVectorizer` on the `data.review` column, the resulting transformed text data is stored in `X` as an array, which will be used as input features for model training.\n",

In this encoding, positive reviews are labeled as `1`, while negative reviews are labeled as `0`. This encoding is crucial for binary classification tasks, where the model needs to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments. The transformed sentiment data is stored in `y`, which will serve as the target variable for the machine learning model, enabling it to learn the relationship between the review content and the corresponding sentiment."

        "\n",
        "1. **Supervised Learning:**\n",
        "   - These are predictive algorithms that require a target variable to learn from. The target can either be a categorical feature (used in classification tasks) or a continuous variable (used in regression tasks). Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to make predictions on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
        "   - Unsupervised learning is used for tasks where there is no predefined target variable. These algorithms focus on identifying patterns, relationships, and structures within the data, allowing for data summarization and insight discovery. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Classification Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is Classification?**\n",
        "- Classification is a supervised machine learning method used to predict the class or category of an instance (or a set of instances, known as the test dataset) using a model trained on a pre-labeled dataset (training dataset). The goal of classification is to assign a label to new, unseen data based on the patterns learned during training.\n",

        "#### **Types of Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Binary Classification:**\n",
        "   - In binary classification, there are two class labels. Common examples include:\n",
        "     - **Email Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as either spam or not spam.\n",
        "     - **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining whether the sentiment of a text is positive or negative.\n",
        "   - Popular algorithms for binary classification include:\n",
        "     - Logistic Regression\n",
        "     - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-Class Classification:**\n",
        "   - Multi-class classification tasks involve more than two class labels. Examples include:\n",
        "     - **Face Recognition:** Classifying images into different faces.\n",
        "     - **Plant Species Classification:** Categorizing plants into various species.\n",
        "     - **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Recognizing characters from scanned documents.\n",

        "Evaluating the performance of a machine learning model is crucial to understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data. In this case, the performance of three different Naive Bayes classifiers (Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli) is evaluated using the **accuracy score**. The accuracy score measures the proportion of correctly predicted labels out of the total number of predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this context, the models' accuracy scores are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes Accuracy:** 0.7129\n",
        "  - This indicates that the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier correctly predicted approximately 71.29% of the test data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Accuracy:** 0.8356\n",
        "  - The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier performed better, correctly predicting 83.56% of the test data. This is typically expected when working with text data, as Multinomial Naive Bayes is well-suited for discrete feature distributions like word counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes Accuracy:** 0.8306\n",
        "  - The Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier also performed well, with an accuracy score of 83.06%. This model is effective when features are binary (e.g., word presence/absence), which can also be beneficial for text classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy is a simple yet powerful metric for evaluating classification models, especially when the class distribution is balanced. However, it does not always capture the full picture, especially in cases of imbalanced data. For such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can provide a deeper understanding of model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this evaluation, both the Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers perform similarly well, suggesting that they are more suitable for this particular text classification task compared to Gaussian Naive Bayes."
